enter virtualenv

start r2 in debug mode
>> r2 -d keyscheduled

debug until offset 0x13da
the key got stored on the stack, now lets mark it as symbolic
>> .(markMemorySymbolic <baddr>+0x13da 8 keyinp)

we can see two printf's, one says 'nope' and the otherone 'correct key'

lets mark both with r2 flags by pressing f
>> r4ge.find
>> r4ge.avoid

now start r4ge and wait a bit:
>> .(r4ge)

r4ge output should be:
>> ... log ...
>> PathGroup Results: <SimulationManager with 1 found, 6 avoid>
>> symbolic memory - b'\xef\xcd\xab\x89gE#\x01' - 0x123456789abcdef
>> Do you want to set debugsession to find address (y/n)?
